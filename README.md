# Forex Trading Bots

This repository contains a collection of automated Forex trading bots that I am developing and testing across different strategies and market conditions.

## 📌 Overview

The goal of this project is to build, optimize, and document multiple algorithmic trading systems, including:

- Scalping bots
- Day trading bots
- Swing trading bots
- Strategy-specific bots (e.g., SMC, breakout, trend-following, mean reversion)
- Experimental and AI-based bots (future updates)

Each bot is designed with:
- Clear entry & exit logic
- Risk management rules
- Backtesting capability
- Performance tracking

## 🛠 Tech Stack

Depending on the bot:
- MQL4 / MQL5 (MetaTrader)
- Python
